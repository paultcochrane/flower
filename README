=== Flower -- Petal for Perl 6

Petal is the Perl Template Attribute Language (Perl 5), and is derived from the 
TAL, METAL and TALES specifications from Zope (Python).

Flower is an implementation of Petal in Perl 6.

It's not the same as the Perl 5 implementation, and has a different
feature-set and parsing model.

That said, it tries to implement as much of Petal as possible in a mostly
compatible form, major differences are listed below.

Note: Flower is not yet complete, and is still missing a lot of functionality.
      See the docs/TODO.txt for a list of things I'm planning on adding.

= Requirements:

 - Exemel, the XML library that powers Flower.

= Optional libraries:

 - Temporal-Utils, needed if you want to use Flower::Utils::Date

= Major Differences from Petal:

 * The default local namespace is 'tal', and to override it, you must
   declare http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/tal instead of the Petal namespace.
 * Flower can use template strings instead of requiring files.
 * Flower does not support the multiple template files based on language.
 * Adding custom modifiers is completely different in Flower.
 * There is NO support for anything but well-formed XML.
   There is no equivelant to the Petal::Parser::HTB, and no plans for one.
   Use well-formed XML, it's just better.
 * Flower supports petal:block elements, as per the PHPTAL project.
 * There is no 'structure' keyword. Strings are turned into Exemel::Text
   objects. If you really want to use XML structures in a replace or content
   statement, return an Exemel::Element.
 * Nested repeats cannot use the same attribute name, it will get clobbered.
 * The built-in repeat object is implemented as per the Zope/PHPTAL, not
   the Petal version. Note: it does not support the 'letter' or 'Letter' 
   attributes, but instead has some new methods that take paramters: 
     'every xx'   the number (not the index) is divisible by xx.
     'never xx'   the number is not divisible by xx.
     'gt xx'      the number is greater than xx.
     'lt xx'      the number is less than xx.
     'eq xx'      the number is equal to xx.
     'ne xx'      the number is not equal to xx.

The above list will be updated as this project is developed, as I'm sure
other changes will be introduced that will be a gotchya for users of Petal,
Zope or PHPTAL.

= Flower::Utils

Inspired by Petal::Utils, Flower includes a namespace called Flower::Utils::
If you load modules in the Petal::Utils:: namespace, it will add additional
modifiers. The following sets are planned for inclusion:

  - Text, same as the :text set from Petal::Utils
  - Logic, same as the :logic set from Petal::Utils
  - List, same as the :list set from Petal::Utils
  - Hash, same as the :hash set from Petal::Utils
  - Date, similar to the :date set from Petal::Utils, using on DateTime::Utils
    Not exactly the same, it offers strftime: and rfc: and works on
    DateTime and Date objects in addition to epoch timestamps.
    If you pass a DateTime or Date object without one of these filters you
    will get its standard stringification form (ISO by default.)
  - Perl, makes a 'perl:' modifier available, which is the counterpart
    to Zope's 'python:' or PHPTAL's 'php:' modifiers.
  - Debug, similar to :debug set from Petal::Utils.
    dump: modifier spits out the .perl representation of the object.
    what: modifier spits out the class name of the object.

URI is not included (feel free to write it if you need it.)
I'm sure new exciting libraries will be made adding onto these.
