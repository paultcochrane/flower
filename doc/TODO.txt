Things yet to do (in the order they will likely be done in):

 - Clean up the alpha-isms that are still hanging about.
 - Finish implementing Flower::TAL::TALES::* plugins, as per the README.
 - Implement query caching (it will be optional)
 - Implement multiple paths (/test/path1 | /test/path2) support.
 - Implement on-error.

Things not likely to be done by me (feel free to do them):

  - The I18N sub-lang.
