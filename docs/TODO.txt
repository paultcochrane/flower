Things yet to do (in the order they will likely be done in):

 - Massive rewrite! The original Flower was sort of based
   on Petal from Perl 5. Sort of, but not really.
   Since then, it's diverged quite significantly.
   However, I have also started my own fork of the Perl 5
   Template::TAL library, and really like the module way
   that it is structured. I intend to completely restructure
   Flower to be more modular like Template::TAL. The various
   XML sublangs will be separated out into their own libraries,
   the same way that 'modifiers' are done now.
   The exact implementation details are not quite settled upon yet.
   This will make Flower into an XML extension and manipulation framework
   rather than just  an implementation of TAL/METAL/TALES,
   although those will still be the default sub-langs.

 - Finish implementing Flower::Utils, as per the README.
   Although they will no longer by in that namespace, as they will be
   using the new framework described above.
 - Implement query caching (it will be optional)
 - Implement multiple paths (/test/path1 | /test/path2) support.
 - Implement on-error.

Things not likely to be done by me (feel free to do them):

  - The I18N sub-lang.
